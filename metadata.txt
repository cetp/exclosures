### species data for Ecology.csv ###
This file contains species-level data about the 24 species investigated in this study. 
Each row represents a species

Family, Genus, species: 	Taxonomic identifiers
Sowing.group:				In which of the four periods was this species used?
Sowing.date: 				On what date were seeds of this species added to the exclosure cages? format YYYY-MM-DD
Ending.date: 				On what date were seeds of this species last observed? format YYYY-MM-DD
obs.length: 				Over what time-span were seeds of this species observed, in days
n.obs.dates: 				On how many occasions were seeds of this species observed?
SM:							Species-mean seed mass, in mg. This is an average of at least 30 seeds taken from at least 3 adult trees
WD:							Species-mean sapwood density, in gÂ·cm^3. This is an average of at least 3 adult trees
total density:				Stem density of adults of this species, from permanent plots scattered across teh terra firme (never-flooded) and floodplain forests of the Manu River watershed. 


### observation data for Ecology.csv ###
This file contains data about the observations of performance of the 24 species investigated in this study. 
Each row represents an observation of a single species made on a specific date on a specific exclosure cage
species:					Which of the 24 species was observed? (Genus and species)
sp code:					A six-letter code to identify each species (4 letters of Genus, 2 letters of species)
block:						In which of the 8 geographical blocks was the observed exclosure cage?
treatment:					Which mammal-exclusion treatment had been applied to the observed exclosure cage?
date:						On what date was the observation made? format YYYY-MM-DD
obs period:					Censuses were occasionally made over the course of 2 (or more) days. This is a simplification of teh preceding column, taking the first of multi-day censuses. format YYYY-MM-DD
Sowing group:				In which of the four periods was this observation made?
bout:						Observation bouts were numbered sequentially within Sowing groups.
obs day:					How many days had elapsed between the beginning of the sowing group and the observation?
seed:						How many intact seeds of the species were observed in the exclosure?
seedling:					How many intact seedlings of the species were observed in the exclosure?
